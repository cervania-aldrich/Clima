     The function to parse the JSON formatted data retrieved from openweatherapi.
     
     In order to successfully parse JSON formatted data, we must:
     1. Inform our complier of how the data is structured. (Create a struct for that data natvely)
     2. Create JSON decoder object.
     3. Use decode method. Note that the first parmeter requires the type of the data itself, not the name of the type. The second parameter is the data we want to encode.
     4. decode can throw, which means we must mark it with a try keyword, and a do/catch block. Also it returns, so store a variable to this result. (Also, try to print out the decoded data to the console to test if the data is accurate and if the code works so far).
     5. Now that we have decoded the JSON data, we should store this data in a WeatherModel, so that we can put the data in our UI.
     6. Return the weatherModel object to where we parsed the JSON, i.e the URLSession task.
