Note there are other location services we could use (see "running the standard location service" topic in CLLocationManager), but requestLocation is what we need for this app because we are only requesting one location, unlike a GPS which is requesting for multiple locations. Now with how apple has designed the Core Location framework, we don't directly access the location information directly from CLLocationManager, instead we use the didUpdateLocations delegate method (from CLLocationManagerDelegate) that contains location object(s) inside of it, and then we can write some code to handle those location objects. See the didUpdateLocations() to see how we handled those location objects!
